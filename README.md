### Converted to Bootstrap v5.2
#### Jumbotron
The biggest challenge as a result of using Bootstrap v5.2 was the removal of the jumbotron component. [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/examples/jumbotron/) suggests that jumbotrons can be recreated using several different utilities.

### Semantic HTML
#### Quotes
Substituted `<h2 class="fst-italic fw-light">` for `<blockquote class="h2 fst-italic fw-light">` per [WHATWG](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-blockquote-element) to improve the semantics.

## To-Do list
* Eliminate scroll on smaller screen sizes
* Refine spacings to be consistent
* Refine layout
* Improve README.md
